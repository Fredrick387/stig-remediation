# STIG: WN11-CC-000370 – SMBv1 protocol must be disabled

## System / Scope
- System: Microsoft Windows 11 Pro 64-bit (Azure virtual machine, x64)
- Environment: Azure-hosted, domain-joined virtual machine in East US 2 (Zone 1)
- Role of system: User workstation endpoint used for security testing and STIG remediation within a controlled cyber range environment

## Finding
- The SMBv1 protocol was not explicitly disabled.
- SMBv1 contains known weaknesses and is vulnerable to exploitation.

## Security Impact
- Use of SMBv1 exposes the system to legacy protocol attacks.
- Attackers could exploit SMBv1 to gain unauthorized access or move laterally.

## Remediation Performed
- Disabled SMBv1 via policy-backed registry configuration.
- Ensured SMB server does not permit SMBv1 connections.

### PowerShell Remediation Script
```powershell
New-Item -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters" -Force | Out-Null
Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters" -Name "SMB1" -Type DWord -Value 0
```

## Validation
- Verified SMBv1 is disabled on the SMB server.
- Confirmed via registry inspection.

### PowerShell Validation Command
```
Get-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters" -Name "SMB1"
```

## Notes
- Disabling SMBv1 does not affect RDP connectivity.
- Modern SMB versions (SMBv2/SMBv3) remain available.
