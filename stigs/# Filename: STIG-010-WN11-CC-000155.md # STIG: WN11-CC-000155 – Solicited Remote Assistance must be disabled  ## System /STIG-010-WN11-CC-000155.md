# STIG: WN11-CC-000155 – Solicited Remote Assistance must be disabled

## System / Scope
- System: Microsoft Windows 11 Pro 64-bit (Azure virtual machine, x64)
- Environment: Azure-hosted, domain-joined virtual machine in East US 2 (Zone 1)
- Role of system: User workstation endpoint used for security testing and STIG remediation within a controlled cyber range environment

## Finding
- Solicited Remote Assistance was not explicitly disabled.
- Allowing solicited assistance enables remote users to view or control local sessions.

## Security Impact
- Remote users could gain unauthorized visibility or control of the system.
- Increases the risk of data exposure or misuse of local resources.

## Remediation Performed
- Checked the existing Remote Assistance policy state.
- Disabled Solicited Remote Assistance using a policy-backed registry configuration.
