# STIG: WN11-CC-000330 – WinRM Client Basic authentication must be disabled

## System / Scope
- System: Microsoft Windows 11 Pro 64-bit (Azure virtual machine, x64)
- Environment: Azure-hosted, domain-joined virtual machine in East US 2 (Zone 1)
- Role of system: User workstation endpoint used for security testing and STIG remediation within a controlled cyber range environment

## Finding
- WinRM Client was configured to allow Basic authentication.
- Basic authentication transmits credentials in plaintext when not protected by TLS.

## Security Impact
- Credentials may be exposed to interception during remote management sessions.
- Attackers could reuse captured credentials for lateral movement.

## Remediation Performed
- Disabled WinRM Client Basic authentication.
- Enforced via registry-backed policy using PowerShell.

### PowerShell Remediation Script
```powershell
Set-ItemProperty `
  -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WinRM\Client" `
  -Name "AllowBasic" `
  -Type DWord `
  -Value 0 `
  -Force
```

## Validation

- Verified WinRM Client Basic authentication is disabled.
- Confirmed via registry value inspection.

### PowerShell Validation Command
```
Get-ItemProperty `
  -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WinRM\Client" `
  -Name "AllowBasic"
```
## Notes

- This change does not impact RDP connectivity.
- WinRM continues to function using Kerberos or certificate-based authentication.
