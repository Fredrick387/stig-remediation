# STIG: WN11-CC-000330 – WinRM Client Basic authentication must be disabled

## System / Scope
- System: Microsoft Windows 11 Pro 64-bit (Azure virtual machine, x64)
- Environment: Azure-hosted, domain-joined virtual machine in East US 2 (Zone 1)
- Role of system: User workstation endpoint used for security testing and STIG remediation within a controlled cyber range environment

## Finding
- WinRM Client Basic authentication was not explicitly disabled.
- Allowing Basic authentication can expose credentials if used without strong transport protection.

## Security Impact
- Credentials may be transmitted in plaintext under certain configurations.
- Exposed credentials could be reused for unauthorized access or lateral movement.

## Remediation Performed
- Created the WinRM Client policy registry path.
- Disabled WinRM Client Basic authentication by setting the policy value to `0`.

### PowerShell Remediation Script
```powershell
New-Item -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WinRM\Client" -Force | Out-Null
Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WinRM\Client" -Name "AllowBasic" -Type DWord -Value 0
```

## Validation

- Verified WinRM Client Basic authentication is disabled.
- Confirmed via registry value inspection.

### PowerShell Validation Command
```
Get-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WinRM\Client" -Name "AllowBasic"
```
## Notes

- This change does not impact RDP connectivity.
- WinRM continues to function using Kerberos or certificate-based authentication.
