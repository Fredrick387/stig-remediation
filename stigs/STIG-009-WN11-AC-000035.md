# STIG: WN11-AC-000035 – Minimum password length must be at least 14 characters

## System / Scope
- System: Microsoft Windows 11 Pro 64-bit (Azure virtual machine, x64)
- Environment: Azure-hosted, domain-joined virtual machine in East US 2 (Zone 1)
- Role of system: User workstation endpoint used for security testing and STIG remediation within a controlled cyber range environment

## Finding
- The minimum password length policy was not explicitly enforced to 14 characters.
- Weak password length increases the likelihood of credential compromise.

## Security Impact
- Short passwords are more susceptible to brute-force and password-spraying attacks.
- Compromised credentials can lead to unauthorized access and lateral movement.

## Remediation Performed
- Created a temporary security policy template enforcing a minimum password length of 14 characters.
- Applied the policy using `secedit` to update local account policy settings.

### PowerShell Remediation Script
```powershell
$infPath = "$env:TEMP\minpwd.inf"

@"
[System Access]
MinimumPasswordLength = 14
"@ | Set-Content -Path $infPath -Encoding ASCII

secedit /configure /db secedit.sdb /cfg $infPath /areas SECURITYPOLICY /quiet
```

## Validation
- Verified the minimum password length policy is set to 14 characters.
- Confirmed via local security policy export.

## PowerShell Validation Command
```
secedit /export /cfg "$env:TEMP\secpol_check.inf" /quiet
Select-String -Path "$env:TEMP\secpol_check.inf" -Pattern "MinimumPasswordLength"
```

## Notes
- This change does not affect existing passwords until they are changed.
- This configuration does not impact RDP connectivity.
