# STIG: WN11-SO-000005 – Accounts: Administrator account status must be disabled

## System / Scope
- System: Microsoft Windows 11 Pro 64-bit (Azure virtual machine, x64)
- Environment: Azure-hosted, domain-joined virtual machine in East US 2 (Zone 1)
- Role of system: User workstation endpoint used for security testing and STIG remediation within a controlled cyber range environment

## Finding
- The built-in Administrator account (RID 500) was reviewed for compliance.
- The account must be disabled to meet DISA STIG requirements.

## Security Impact
- An enabled built-in Administrator account is a high-value target due to its well-known SID.
- Use of shared administrator accounts reduces accountability and increases attack surface.

## Remediation Performed
- Disabled the built-in Administrator account (RID 500).
- Enforced via local account management using PowerShell.

### PowerShell Remediation Script
```powershell
# Locate the built-in Administrator account by RID 500
$admin = Get-LocalUser | Where-Object { $_.SID.Value.EndsWith("-500") }

if ($admin -and $admin.Enabled) {
    Disable-LocalUser -Name $admin.Name
}
```
## Validation
- Verified the built-in Administrator account is disabled.
- Confirmed via local user account query.

### PowerShell Validation Command
```
Get-LocalUser | Where-Object { $_.SID.Value.EndsWith("-500") }
```

## Notes
- The built-in Administrator account should remain disabled during normal operations.
- Administrative access should be performed using named administrator accounts.
