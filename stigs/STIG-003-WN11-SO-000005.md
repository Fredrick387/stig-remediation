# STIG: WN11-SO-000005 – Accounts: Administrator account status must be disabled

## System / Scope
- System: Microsoft Windows 11 Pro 64-bit (Azure virtual machine, x64)
- Environment: Azure-hosted, domain-joined virtual machine in East US 2 (Zone 1)
- Role of system: User workstation endpoint used for security testing and STIG remediation within a controlled cyber range environment

## Finding
- The built-in Administrator account (RID 500) was identified using its security identifier.
- The account was found to be enabled, which does not meet DISA STIG requirements.

## Security Impact
- An enabled built-in Administrator account is a high-value target due to its well-known RID.
- Abuse of this account can enable privilege escalation and reduce accountability.

## Remediation Performed
- Identified the built-in Administrator account by SID ending in `-500`.
- Disabled the account using PowerShell to enforce STIG compliance.

### PowerShell Remediation Script
```powershell
$admin = Get-CimInstance Win32_UserAccount |
Where-Object { $_.SID -like '*-500' }

if ($admin -and -not $admin.Disabled) {
    net user "$($admin.Name)" /active:no
}
```

## Validation

- Verified the built-in Administrator account is disabled.
- Confirmed via CIM query against the account SID.

### Powershell Validation Command
```
Get-CimInstance Win32_UserAccount |
Where-Object { $_.SID -like '*-500' } |
Select-Object Name, Disabled
```
## Notes

- The built-in Administrator account may be renamed; identification by RID 500 ensures accuracy.
- The account should remain disabled during normal operations.
